Hello <%= @user.name %>,

It has been a while since you uploaded a photo for <%= @group.recipients.sample.name %>. Simply send your pictures to <%= @group.email_address %>.

<%= @group.photos_missing_for_next_order %> more photos and <%= @group.recipients.map(&:name).to_sentence %> will receive the album in no time!

Thanks,
Tasveer
